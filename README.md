### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm Stefanie, an environmental scientist with a passion for web development. I used to code with Python and R, and recently completed a boot camp in web development with Hyperion. Through the program, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and now I'm ready to put my knowledge into practice.

One of my proudest projects was creating websites to display the works of aspiring artists. This project allowed me to bring together my technical and creative skills to create beautiful and user-friendly websites.

I'm always seeking new challenges to improve my skills and stay current with the latest technologies. Currently, I'm learning about web accessibility, and I'm committed to ensuring that my work is accessible to all users.

Aside from web development, I love cake and enjoy hiking :)
